<p>I'm most adept at story telling when it comes to recounting recent events,
as opposed to coming up with new ones. In this case, I have a story 
regarding a recent (accidental) injury. My dog is very tiny and is the kind
of dog who gets scared going outside alone at night. He attempted to
get my other dog to go outside with him in solidarity, to which dog 2 
did not even budge from his spot. Feeling bad for my tiny dog, I walked him
out to our back porch, thinking I'd go into the yard with him so he wasn't 
all alone. Our porch is on our second floor, having wooden stairs that
lead out into the yard. Walking down the steps I have taken hundreds of
times, I somehow skipped the entire last step, crashing hard onto the pavement
beneath me. In the scuffle, I managed to twist my ankle and cut my foot,
despite landing backwards. Now, this may seem like a crappy accident that
doesn't warrant much story, but it's a repeat of something that happened the 
last time I went on vacation (pre-Covid). In that story, I missed the barest
decline of step walking to the beach and fell entirely to the ground. During
that fall, I cut my leg so badly that there is a permanent scar. I also
twisted my ankle so much that it swelled to the size of a tennis ball and turned
purple/blue. Oh, did I also mention that was our first day of vacation?
Actual first day arriving and first day trip to the beach, and I injured
myself for the rest of the trip. Seems as though my sense of gravity or my balance
is not so good. Or maybe we can blame it on my eyes, despite having glasses!
